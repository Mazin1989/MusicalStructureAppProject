# MusicalStructureAppProject
Udacity project - part of *Androids Basics by Google* course

In this project we are required to have:
- 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
- A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
- A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.

# What benefits does this project have?
The following project would combine all the skills learned thus far during the Udactity - Androids Basics by Google course which includes:
- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- Creating your own Custom Class
- Looping through an ArrayList
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
